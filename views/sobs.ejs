              <h1 class="text-center">School of Buddhist Studies and Civilization</h1>
              <br>
              <p class="text-justify">Buddhist Studies & Civilization is the academic study of Buddhism which applies especially to the modern academic field and is distinct from Buddhist philosophy or Buddhist theology. Buddhism is a growing force in the world. In recent years there has been a tremendous upsurge of interest in the religious studies, particularly in America and Europe. We have also seen a worldwide increase in academic interest in the relationship between science and Buddhist teachings. As a consequence of this development, interest in and study of Buddhism is no longer restricted to believers and religious academics but has attracted wider participation by people in many other fields and religious backgrounds. This has in turn produced an even richer pool of talent and knowledge that will enrich serious Buddhist studies. In line with this trend, the School of Buddhist Studies & Civilization of Gautam Buddha University was established in 2011 to promote the study of and research into all aspects of Buddhism and its relevance to the world of today. Here, it is imperative to mention that probably this is the only University in India where this discipline is started as a Faculty/School and not as Department. It is the first of its kind to be set up in India
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                The School of Buddhist Studies & Civilization oversees a variety of research programs, scholarly events, and outreach activities, often in collaboration with units on and off campus. Activities include a colloquium series, conferences, a visiting scholar program, etc. The School is dedicated to promoting and supporting scholarship in Buddhist Studies in a spirit of non-sectarian tolerance and with scientific research and communication as preeminent objectives. It seeks to promote the academic study, and teaching, of all aspects of Buddhist thought, practice, social, economic, human rights, animal right, global issues of concern including historical interactions with Buddhist developments in South, East, and Central Asia. The Gautam Buddha University started it academic activities in 2009 but academic activities of this School started since November 2011 with appointment of eleven (11) faculty members. By the end of December 2011, the faculty members have prepared a course structure form M. A., M. Phil., Ph. D. along with two mandatory papers of Human Values and Buddhist Ethics for UG and PG students of the University. This is also one of the distinct features of this University.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">The School of Buddhist Studies & Civilization is a consequential nucleus for the academic research and discourses leading to the promotion of peace and harmony guided by Buddhist Ethics and human values. The very quintessence of Buddhist Ethics and its practices in global world are torn apart by conflict, hatred and violence and thus have lost its due recognition. Therefore, the research and practices carried out at School reinforces respect for the Buddhist tradition and appreciation for its benevolent values and profound spiritual emancipation. The research and other programmes offered in School intertwined together the diverse theories in Buddhism and its expressions in our day to day life, mediating a meaningful inclusion of Buddhist values in our cultural, social and intellectual assumptions. It stands out as an effort to revitalize the Buddhist Ethics and practices which find immense significance in the modern context. The school encourages comparative study of Buddhism vis-à-vis other major world religions and their philosophies with an attempt to understand how the various Buddhist movements across the world have helped the societies in their emergence, for instance the Dalit Movement in India. It also facilitates researches aimed at finding ways of resolving national and international conflicts and disputes through the application of Buddhist principles and values. With a rich and magnificent literate collection in our library, a marvellous meditation centre and a conducive and tranquil lush green campus, the School promises a very productive academic engagement and practice of Buddhist techniques of Vipassana under qualified supervision. In addition to the above, the School provides an ideal forum for cross-cultural, interfaith and intellectual dialogues of scholars through conventions, symposia, seminars, conferences, lectures, etc. The School promotes academic collaboration, MoUs, joint research programmes and faculty and student exchange programmes with academic institutions of repute dedicated to Buddhist Studies in the World. In order to do so, last year i.e. 2013, School has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Dhammachai International Research Institute (DIRI) based in Bangkok, Thailand, New Zealand and Australia.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">The USP of this school is its international students whose number is as much as almost 90% of total enrolment. At present, the total strength of school is approximately 132. Maximum Numbers of students admitted in various programmes of the school are International Students belongs to as many as 10 countries (Buddhist Countries of Asian) viz. Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, South Korea, China, USA, Nepal, Afghanistan, etc. </p>

            <br>
            <p>The School of Buddhist Studies and Civilization is a consequential nucleus for the academic research and discourses leading to the promotion of peace and harmony guided by Buddhist Ethics and human values. The very quintessence of Buddhist Ethics and its practices in global world are torn apart by conflict, hatred, and violence and thus have lost its due recognition. Therefore, the research and practices carried out at School reinforces respect for the Buddhist tradition and appreciation for its benevolent values and profound spiritual emancipation. The research and other programmes offered in School intertwined together the diverse theories in Buddhism and its expressions in our day to day life, mediating a meaningful inclusion of Buddhist values in our cultural, social, and intellectual assumptions. It stands out as an effort to revitalize the Buddhist ethics and practices which find immense significance in the modern context. The school encourages comparative study of Buddhism vis-à-vis other major world religions and their philosophies with an attempt to understand how the various Buddhist movements across the world have helped the societies in their emergence, for instance the Dalit Movement in India. It also facilitates researches aimed at finding ways of resolving national and international conflicts and disputes through the application of Buddhist principles and values. With a rich and magnificent collection in our library, a marvellous meditation centre and a conducive and tranquil lush green campus, the School promises a very productive academic engagement and practice of Buddhist techniques of Vipassana under qualified supervision. In addition to the above, the School provides an ideal forum for cross-cultural, interfaith and intellectual dialogues of scholars through conventions, symposia, seminars, conferences, lectures, etc. The School promotes academic collaboration, joint research programmes and faculty and student exchange programmes with academic institutions of repute dedicated to Buddhist Studies in the World. In order to do so, last year i.e. 2013, School has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Dhammachai International Research Institute (DIRI) based in Bangkok, Thailand, New Zealand, and Australia.

            <h5>What all we offer:</h5>
            <p class="text-justify">The programme is intended for students, monks, nuns, teachers, psychologists, social workers and counsellors who want to study how Buddhist teachings add a new dimension to the science of human psyche and how they are applied to their daily work. It is also for individuals who are interested in the philosophy of life and want to study Buddhism and its practice as a means for spiritual development in a comprehensive and scientific way. We believe that our programmes of studies offer a new dimension on the study of Buddhism. The traditional approach of study was based on learning religious texts and commentaries and was largely conducted in monasteries and specialized institutes. Our programmes go far beyond this by offering new perspectives on many other areas not traditionally associated with the study of the religion. The programmes will offer students the opportunity to study Buddhism not only as a religion but also as a philosophy, an ethics system and in metaphysical terms. They will also be of interest to those who wish to learn more about the international academic research being carried out into the relationship between science and Buddhism. Through a fundamental understanding of Buddhist teachings, the programmes will enable students to develop better mind and life-management skills. The courses provide you with a step by step approach that gently leads students through an overview of the world of Buddhism. The program focuses on the study of canonical and post-canonical languages and literature of the Buddhist tradition. Therefore, successful completion of the program requires extensive language and textual study. The program offers a concentration in South Asian Buddhism with the relevant languages (Sanskrit, Pali, Gandhari, and Chinese). Related courses in disciplines other than language and literature, such as cultural anthropology, history, philosophy, religion, and ethnomusicology, constitute an important part of the program, and students will normally take courses in these disciplines. In particular, our Master of Buddhist Studies & Civilization Programme (M. A.) and postgraduate research programme leading to the award of M. Phil. and Ph. D. degrees provide participants with the opportunity to explore how Buddhist teachings may add a new dimension to the science of the human psyche and how their application may enhance effectiveness in their personal and professional lives. We believe that India uniquely combines an Eastern culture and tradition with all the dynamism of an ultra-modern and cosmopolitan society and therefore provides the perfect setting for an academic centre that offers Buddhist studies set firmly in an international context.
            </p>
            <p>The specific program of courses will be worked out on an individual basis between the student and faculty. Prospective students should consult with the Dean/Head of Department of the School (Foreign nationals are advised to consult Director, International Affairs). <br>
