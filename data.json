Due to the widespread availability of its usage, it has become an indispensable tool. A plethora of information floods through the web every second. Present web consisting of HTML documents only display its contents, without understanding human intention so unable to find out context of word used. If the user enters a synonym of a word in the search box, keyword based search engine fails to retrieve actually required information desired by the user. Due to lack of semantics, web pages are unable to interpret the meaning and machine is unable to understand searcher intention. In this work, Sem-Modelhas been proposed to address the problems with these current indexing schemes. In this research work, to retrieve relevant information framework for extracting and visualizing semantic knowledge has been designed in which concept and relations among entities are extracted automatically to develop ontology representing facts and knowledge which helps in understanding userâ€™s need to retrieve relevant information. Ontology learning and Sentiment analysis is carried out on the dataset of tweets available using big data platform. The studies reflect the userâ€™s behavioural responses on a particular topic. To create semantic knowledge representation, semantic annotation has been done and documents are retrieved by matching the semantic description of user query with annotated documents. The document search is performed by Semantically Extended Query Module. It matches the semantic description of user query with its counterparts in annotated documents. This work has focus on improving effective information obtaining mechanism using more effective inference mechanism for finding similar concepts to given query so that better Precision and Recall has been achieved. Keyword search engines are unable to understand the intention of user as a result they produce enormous results for user to distinguish between relevant and non relevant answers of user queries. This has led to rise in requirement to work search capabilities of different search engines. In this research work, experimental evaluation is done based on different metrics to distinguish different search engines on the basis of type of query that can be handled by them. The experimental results demonstrate that for single term query, Google retrieves more relevant documents and DuckDuckGo retrieves more relevant documents for NLP queries.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div style='font-weight: bold;'><br></div></div><div><b>Component Based Software Quality Prediction Using Soft Computing Techniques</b></div><div><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>In todayâ€™s technological world the Component-Based Software System is applied in&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>various fields of engineering, to ease their multitasking function. In Component-Based&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>Software Engineering, the software functions are created as components, it can reuse for&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>different purpose.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>So, the quality of these software component should ensure,&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>before implementation. In the beginning the techniques such as ISO 9126, Bertoa, ISO&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>25010, CBQM and Alvaro model are utilized to analysis the quality of software. The&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>prediction performance of these quality measures is not up to the mark with&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>conventional approaches, hence this work motivated to develop a soft computing-based&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>prediction approach for the software quality prediction. This work proposed four&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>different approaches for the software quality prediction.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>In the first approach an improved particle swarm optimization based neural network is&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>presented for the prediction of software quality. The IPSO proposed to tune the neural&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>network based on the reliability value. Then to enhance the prediction performance the&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>second approach proposed an optimal fuzzy classifier based with evolutionary&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>programming. The evolutionary programming is used for the optimal fuzzy rule&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>selection, so that the decision accuracy of fuzzy can enhance. In comparison with the&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>previous IPSO, the optimal fuzzy classifier provided better prediction performance such&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>as reliability and maintainability.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>In the third approach, a hybrid cuckoo search based advanced neural network is&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>presented for the software quality prediction. In this approach the HCS used to tune the&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>neural network, and to enhance the performance of ANN. The proposed approach is&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>compared with the previous IPSO and evolutionary programming. Among them the&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>HCS based quality prediction provided better performance.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>In the last approach a novel teaching-learning optimization based artificial neural&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>network is proposed for the effective prediction of software quality in CBS system. The&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>proposed TLO employed in the training phase of ANN for the weight optimization.

These requirements are useful for the quality assurance in Component-Based Software (CBS) and measure the behaviour of interfaces of components through which these components interact with each other. This work focuses on dynamic measurement of CBS. This work analyzes the run time behavior of CBS to measure it dynamically. In order to incorporate changes in software components at run time, it is required to analyze the dependencies among the components. This work has proposed a function which is used in software components integration. The proposed function first validates the properties of components by passing some parameters and then calculates its usability factor. The dependency function helps to find out the component usability when the components need to be integrated to get the required functionality at the time of execution. The proposed dynamic metric called Component Usability Metric (CUM) calculates its dependency factors based on the parametric values for the components. The dependency function helps to find out the Component Usability Factor (CUF) when the components are integrated to get the required functionality of that component during the execution. This metric will help to identify the functionality level of a component within the integrated software system. Another proposed component metric called Component Interface Metric (CIM) is also used to measure the interface complexity of the CBS. This proposed metric is measured with the help of CUM. These dynamic metrics are used to improve the performance of JEE application to evaluate the quality of a real-time system with the help of NGET Application of Indian railway. The quality characteristics of CBS are assessed through CUM dynamic metric.</span><br></div><div><span style='font-size: 1rem;'><br></span></div><div><span style='font-weight: bolder;'>Software Quality Prediction for Component Based Software Using Computational Intelligence</span></div><div><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>Software Quality means the stakeholder satisfaction. It includes both - the consumer and the producer of the software system. Software Quality Assurance (SQA) means the meeting of the stakeholderâ€™s requirements in a particular environment. There are so many SQA models are present like- McCall model, ISO/IEC-9126 model etc. During last few years, a new field called Computational Intelligence had emerged as an excellent tool for solving a vast variety of problems and to support the various engineering techniques. The literature has shown itâ€™s overwhelming applications in an area of SQA. This work is an exploration and exploitation of computational and non-computational based techniques in the domain of SQA. The researcher are using CI techniques for the assessment of individual quality characteristics only but this work shows that the SQA is a combinatorial problem which depends upon a number of quality characteristics. This work given an optimal mathematical model for the assessment of degree of stakeholder satisfaction (Q) by predicting the different quality attributes like reliability, reusability etc. at a common extent of time in a combined form. The experimental with case work shows that the mathematical model for SQA is an optimal model for the calculation of Q. SQA team can generate the minimum and maximum values of Q with the help of the proposed optimal model. New optimization algorithms like Improved-Ant Colony Optimization (I-ACO) algorithm, Hybrid Cuckoo-ACO algorithm and Visualization power optimization algorithm also been introduced in this work for the assessment of the quality characteristics.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style='font-weight: bolder;'><br></span></div><div><span style='font-weight: bolder;'>Reliability Prediction for Component-Based Software by using Soft Computing Techniques</span><div><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>The reliability assessment of software system has always been a thrust area for the software engineering researchers. The reliability prediction becomes easier if important factors and relationship between factors affecting reliability are identified. Identification and assessment of these factors to develop a reliable system is a difficult task. This work identified the CBS factors which are used for predicting the reliability of CBS. This work proposed Component-Based Software Reliability Model by identifying the CBS factors like complexity, failure, component dependency, reusability, and component interaction etc. But, to design and develop an efficient reliability model, many techniques have been used by researchers and practitioners to predict and estimate the reliability of CBS. However, the soft computing techniques have become very popular due to finding the optimized result of a given problem. This work assesses the various soft computing techniques which are necessary to predict the reliability of CBS. Few CBSE metrics have also been applied to assess the soft computing techniques like ACO, PSO, and ABC to develop CBS reliability model. On the basis of assessment of soft computing techniques, it is found that PSO and fuzzy approaches are more capable of predicting the CBS reliability. To predict the reliability of CBS, fuzzy and PSO techniques are adopted to evaluate the proposed model. The proposed model is capable of predicting the reliability and performance of CBS using soft computing techniques. The verification and validation of CBSRM are performed using MATLAB with Quality of Web Service data-sets to observe the results of the proposed model.</span></div><div><span style='font-size: 1rem;'><span style='font-weight: bolder;'><br></span></span></div><div><span style='font-weight: bolder;'>Analysis and Evaluation of ECG Signal for Emotion Recognition using Computational Intelligence</span></div><div><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>In this work, a computational system has been designed for recognition of emotional states i.e. calm, stress and anger by analyzing ECG morphological features pattern.For validation of this research, an authentic ECG real-time data of 17 drivers is used which was acquired in emotion simulated pathways. A system for emotion recognition based on extraction of ECG pattern features i.e. QRS, P wave and ST segment is designed. This system also includes preprocessing of ECG signals which increase the accuracy of emotional recognition system. This work is divided into three phases:</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>&nbsp;In first phase, a wavelet based PRFB denoising system is designed for preprocessing and de-noising of ECG signal which eradicates unwanted artifacts and helps to extract features properly.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>After denoising, second phase includes feature extraction of ECG waveform by Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) of wavelet with data flow modeling. Three features i.e. QRS complex, P wave and ST segment of ECG signal were extracted as these features were affected by different emotional states. Till now, nobody used these features to calculate the emotions of human. The novelty lies in the fact that, all the three emotional states i.e. stress, calm and anger are recognized by using only these three features which ultimately reduces the complexity of the overall system. Further, these features have been validated by using statistical analysis with an accuracy rate i.e. Confidence Interval (CI) of 95 %.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>In the third phase of this work, a computational based Mamdani fuzzy system has been developed which computationally examines the different features and determine the emotional states i.e. calm, anger and stress. This proposed fuzzy system has been validated by different cardiologists and mathematically by designing confusion matrix. The proposed system outperforms the conventional systems in terms of accuracy, less complexity and less confusion rate. The accuracy rate of proposed system is 92% with an improvement of 30% in correlation analysis.</span></div><div><span style='font-size: 1rem;'><span style='font-weight: bolder;'><br></span></span></div><div><span style='font-size: 1rem;'><span style='font-weight: bolder;'>Design and Evaluation of Software Testing Technique using Computational Intelligence</span></span><br></div><div><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>About 40-50 % cost of SDLC is spent on software testing; this shows that testing is an expensive process which further gets incremented if it is performed manually. Therefore researchers and practitioners try to reduce the cost of software testing by replacing the manual software testing process by automation. As testing itself has many techniques and three essential costly sub-techniques are â€œAutomatic Test Case Generation (ATCG), Test Case Prioritization (TCP), and Test Case Optimization.â€ Unfortunately, these are performed manually with little automation success rate. Therefore, to reduce the cost of software testing, the success of these sub-techniques is very essential. During last few years, a new field called computational intelligence had emerged as an excellent tool for solving a vast variety of problems. The literature has shown itâ€™s overwhelm application is an area of software testing. This work is an exploration and exploitation of computational and non-computational based techniques in the domain of software testing techniques - ATCG, TCP and Test Case Optimization. For addressing Test Case Optimization, a framework called Hybrid Test Language Processing (HTLP) is proposed. The methodology used in HTLP is based on keyword-oriented data-driven approach called Test Language Processing (TLP) that can be used for both Web and Graphic User Interface (GUI) based applications. The Test Case Optimization is performed by executing the proposed framework on an open source web application. With the successful execution of framework, it is concluded that 83.78 % of Test Suite Optimization is achieved along with thoroughly tested System Under Test (SUT) which is not possible with the manual approach in time bound environment. To address ATCG, a Path-Specific Target (PST) data generation approach is proposed and experimented with several problems.

This work is motivated by four main research objectives: firstly, to develop a component selection process based on clustering, secondly to design and develop a component selection algorithm for it. The third objective is about analyzing and evaluating the performance and complexity of the component selection algorithm. The fourth objective is about the verification and validation of the complete component selection process and algorithm. This work firstly proposes a component selection process with the help of four-tier architecture to select optimal component using clustering. Secondly, it designs and evaluates a fuzzy relation-based fuzzy clustering algorithm for component selection. Finally, the time complexity and performance of the algorithm is calculated and compared with the standard algorithms. According to the fourth objective the verification of the component selection algorithm is carried out by confirming the correctness of each step of the algorithm before writing code for it. The algorithm is validated on a real dataset of components extracted from an online component repository. After verification and validation, the major findings of this work are: the use of clustering has reduced the search space and components are clustered based on multi-attributes rather than considering one or two attributes, as compared to built-in functions of Fuzzy c-means and subtractive clustering. The use of fuzzy clustering based on fuzzy relations has eased the task of selection as the tedious task of minimization or maximization of objective functions is eliminate. This dependency of clustering results on the distance metric for similarity or dissimilarity is eliminated using the proposed FREFCOSCO (Fuzzy Relation-Based Fuzzy Clustering of Software Component) algorithm. The simple fuzzy clustering technique requires mentioning the number of cluster centers beforehand, in case of Fuzzy C-Means and the radii of the cluster in case of subtractive clustering. The performance of the algorithm, when implemented in Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB), is far better than the existing methods. The time complexity as compared to the standard methods is much better. It can be concluded that this work presents a high performance component selection algorithm based on functional and non-functional requirement with a very less computational time. This is supported with the help of the real life database of components taken from the online repository.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style='font-weight: bolder;'><br></span></div><div><span style='font-weight: bolder;'>Design and Evaluation of New Reusability Metrics Based on Fuzzy Approach to Measure the Quality of Component-Based Software</span></div><div style=''><span style='font-size: 1rem;'>Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) supports the practice of building software from the pre-existing component or third party software Component-Off-The-Shelf (COTS). This work would help to manage the quality assurance by measuring reusability which is a significant attribute of software quality. This work helps in analysis, design, and development of reusability metrics to complete the demand of good reusable software components in the software industry. A reusability metrics for proper quantification of the quality characteristic reusability is proposed. This reusability metrics considers five factors: coupling, interface complexity, understandability, customizability, and reliability. The reliability factor is included in this metrics as this work found reliability as a major factor of quality in the literature review. The available literature does not give due importance to reliability in reusability measurement. Despite the growing research in the measurement of quality or some quality attributes of Component-Based Software (CBS), there are few models to automate the reusability measurement of the software component. To automate the reusability measurement of a CBS, a rule-based fuzzy approach is developed based on reusability metrics. For this approach, a set of rules is defined as a rule base. Using this approach, the reusability of a majority of software components can be measured. To test component reusability during interaction, this work proposes reusability metrics for web service components with different set of factors as the quality concern in web services is different. This work modified the factors of reusability metrics for web service component to meet the requirement. Five key factors, coupling, interface complexity, response time and reliability were identified for estimation of reusability in the context of web service components. The individual web service reusability is measured using proposed reusability metrics as well as the reusability of web services under interaction with other web services is also measured with this reusability metrics. The quality of a black box component depends on factors like complexity, reusability, maintainability, and reliability. An individual component quality also influences the overall quality of CBS. This work performed an evaluation of the effect of reusability on the quality of CBS. This was done empirically by examining the effect of reusability metrics attributes on software quality characteristics.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=''><b><br></b></div><div style=''><b>Analysis, Design and Development of Component-Based Reusable Models and Testing Processes</b></div><div style=''>In software engineering, development life cycle processes of any software include all activities of software during its entire life. Historically, traditional model of software development have focused primarily on the functionality of a software system. There are two main groups of models - sequential and evolutionary. The sequential model defines a sequence of activities in which one activity follow after a completion of the previous one. Evolutionary model allows performance of several activities in parallel without requirements on a stringent completion of one activity to be able to start with another one. Well known examples of sequential models are waterfall model and V model, and of evolutionary models are iterative and incremental development, and spiral model. This work proposes a new X model for Component-Based Development (CBD) which comes under the evolutionary model. X model is a complex multifaceted activity that involves several phases - software analysis and specifications, design, coding and archiving, component testing, component wrapping, domain analysis, domain engineering, frameworking, assembling, archiving and design of software components. Finally, X model appears to cover the likely phases of large software development and enforces software reusability along its phases with two processes â€“ development for reuse and development with reuse.</div></div><div><br></div>",
